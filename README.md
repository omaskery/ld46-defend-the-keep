# Defend your Keep!

## Keep it alive!

### Overview

This is my Ludum Dare 46 entry!

Pretty pleased with what I got done, I won't lie I had loftier ambitions - I wanted to somehow make it have some aspect of social/multiplayer, and I'd love to have an actual main menu or post-game screen.

It's technically, sort of, a game, though! :)

### How to play

Left click to fire at a spot, use A or D to move around the circumference of the keep!
